# CRAFT AVR Demo ‚Äî Custom PCB and 3D Enclosure

This repository contains a custom **double-layer PCB** design and a **3D-printable enclosure** for running the [CRAFT demo](http://www.linusakesson.net/scene/craft/) by Linus √Ökesson on an **ATmega88-20PU** microcontroller.

The project is developed in **Autodesk EAGLE** for the PCB layout and includes an **STL enclosure model** designed for FDM 3D printing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Runs the original CRAFT demo at **20 MHz**
- Audio synthesized in real-time by the ATmega88
- Double-layer PCB with clear silkscreen labeling
- Compact size with mounting holes for enclosure
- Powered via ISP header or screw terminal in 3.3 volts

## üñ®Ô∏è Enclosure

- Format: `.stl` for 3D printing
- Designed for FDM printers (0.4 mm nozzle recommended)
- Includes cutouts for VGA, RCA, power terminal, and ISP pins
- Snap-fit
- PCB enclosure case.STL need to be printed with support.

## üõ†Ô∏è Flashing the Firmware

The `firmware/` folder includes:

- `flash.hex` ‚Äî Precompiled firmware for ATmega88-20PU
- `AVR Flasher/` ‚Äî Folder structure compatible with **Flipper Zero**

### üîß Flashing with Flipper Zero

1. Copy the content of `AVR Flasher/` folder to your Flipper Zero's SD card in (`/apps_data/avr_isp/`).
2. Connect your Flipper to the CRAFT PCB via the ISP header.
3. Open the [**AVR Flasher**](https://lab.flipper.net/apps/avr_isp) app on your Flipper.
4. Select Craft_pcb.avr firmware and flash it directly to the ATmega88.
